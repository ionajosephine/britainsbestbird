# Britain's Best Bird: A Tribute Page 🐣

A basic HTML and CSS tribute page to Britain's best bird: the seagull. You can view the masterpiece for yourself [here](https://ionajosephine.github.io/britainsbestbird/)

## Why?

One of the stages of the application process for the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) Javascript bootcamp was to build a basic HTML and CSS website and host it on Github. They must have liked it because I was accepted! ✅🤩

## No, but why Seagulls?!

Although humans (particularly Brits!) love to hate seagulls 😅 they are in fact magnificent birds and are sadly [on the Red List](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/herring-gull/#:~:text=This%20species%20is%20on%20the,declines%20and%20wintering%20population%20declines) due to ongoing population declines. It may sound great that there'll be fewer of them to steal your ice creams 🍦 at the beach but in reality it is part of a wider problem of worldwide species loss (both plants 🌿 and animals 🐼 🐝) due to environmental degradation caused by human activities ☹️. You can read more about how failing to protect our seas 🌊 and oceans 🐟 is leading to an increase in herring gulls in town and cities on the [RSPB website](https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/rspb-news/rspb-news-stories/failing-to-protect-our-seas-and-oceans-leading-to-increase-in-urban-herring-gulls/).
