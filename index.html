            "For the seagull, he is a daring bird,<br>
            And he loves with the storm to sail;<br>
            To ride in the strength of the billowy sea;<br>
            And to breast the driving gale.<br>
            The little boat, she is tossed about,<br>
            Like a seaweed, to and fro;<br>
            The tall ship reels like a drunken man,<br>
            As the gusty tempests blow.<br>
            But the seagull laughs at the pride of man,<br>
            And sails in a wild delight<br>
            On the torn-up breast of the night-black sea,<br>
            Like a foam-cloud, calm and white."<br>
